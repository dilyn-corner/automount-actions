summary: Automatically mount USB and take actions
description: |
  This snap waits for USB plug events of block devices and automatically
  mounts such devices under the /media dir when inserted and then installs
  asserted snaps found there.

confinement: strict

# The daemons are installed as disabled because the snapd-control and
# mount-control interfaces are not auto-connecting. They can be installed as
# enabled if interface auto-connection is enabled either in the Store UI or in
# the gadget snap.

  auto-mount:
    command: usr/bin/auto-mount
